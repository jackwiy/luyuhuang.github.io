Hi, I\'m Luyu Huang. I\'m a software engineer and game developer. I graduate from Jiangxi Normal University in Software Engineering and I have been a game programmer since 2016. I have been working on game programming for *Legacy of Discord* since two years ago, which is a popular game in 198 countries. This site is my personal tech blog, Here I would like share my learning, insights and growth.

I love programming and I also interested in algorithms, mathematics and game designing. I would like to write some articles in these aspects. In addition, I'm a young programmer, I'm still learning. So if you find a mistake in my posts, I would appreciate it if you point it out.
